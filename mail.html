          <p>Subject: Urgent Action Needed for the citizens still affected by the Bhopal Gas Tragedy of 1984: #JusticeForBhopalNow </p>
          <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">I am writing to express my deep concern about the ongoing environmental and health challenges faced by the survivors of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. The aftermath of this tragic event continues to impact the lives of thousands, and it has come to my attention that significant issues persist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been reported (hyperlink report here) that 337 metric tonnes of hazardous waste, remnants of the 1984 gas tragedy, still remain on the premises of Union Carbide India Limited - now taken over by the Dow Chemicals Company. The National Green Tribunal has emphasized the urgency of disposal, and it is imperative that Dow Chemicals takes swift and effective measures to decontaminate the factory site and groundwater in Bhopal. The persistent presence of hazardous waste poses severe threats to both the environment and public health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the cleanup, immediate action is required to provide access to clean drinking water for all those affected by the contamination. Addressing the immediate needs of the community is crucial to mitigate the long-term health impacts caused by the toxic legacy of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I stand in solidarity with the #JusticeForBhopalNow campaign and urge Dow Chemicals to consider the gravity of the situation and prioritize the well-being of the affected communities. It is essential to take responsibility for the cleanup and ensure justice for the survivors. I urge Dow Chemicals to take immediate action on the following demands:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1 Decontaminate the Factory Site and Groundwater</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Undertake an extensive and detailed site assessment of the current contamination status at the former Union Carbide India Limited premises, and collaborate with independent environmental experts and regulatory bodies to ensure a thorough understanding of the extent of hazardous waste</li>
<li>Formulate a robust cleanup plan that adheres to international environmental standards, and engage with local environmental agencies and community representatives to ensure transparency in the cleanup process.</li>
<li>Allocate necessary resources and personnel for the efficient execution of the cleanup plan, implement technologies and methodologies that guarantee the effective removal and disposal of hazardous waste, and regularly update the affected community and stakeholders on the progress of the cleanup efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2 Ensure Access to Clean Drinking Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct an immediate and comprehensive assessment of the water quality in the affected areas; Collaborate with independent environmental agencies to ensure unbiased evaluations.</li>
<li>Invest in water purification technologies to provide immediate relief to the affected community and ensure that the installation of these facilities is prompt and meets the highest standards.</li>
<li>Develop a long-term plan for ensuring ongoing access to clean drinking water for the affected population and explore sustainable water management practices to prevent future contamination.</li>
<li>Establish direct communication channels with the affected community to understand their specific water needs and concerns, and collaborate with community leaders/ local authorities to ensure a sustainable supply of clean drinking water.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter, and I anticipate your prompt action. I look forward to hearing from you on the progress made towards achieving these crucial objectives for the well-being of the people of Bhopal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Concerned Citizen</p>
